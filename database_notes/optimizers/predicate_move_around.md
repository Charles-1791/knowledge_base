# Predicate Move around
## TL;DR
predicate move around = predicate pull up + predicate transition + predicate push down
## Introduction
### Classic Predicate Transition
Based on given predicates, the database can deduce additional ones to optimize query execution. For example, consider the query:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM foo f JOIN bar b ON f.id = b.id AND f.id = 100
```
which has the following LogicalPlan:

Thanks to the transitivity of equality, we can infer that *b.id = 100* must also hold for any tuple to appear in the output. Thus, the above SQL is equivalent to:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM foo f JOIN bar b on f.id = b.id AND f.id = 100 AND b.id = 100
```
The both the predicate *f.id = 100* and the generated one can be push down to nodes below the inner join, resulting in a Plan like this:

Since the filter *id = 100* is applied before, the amount of data flowing into join is reduced. Less data means less memory expense and faster join speed.

### Predicate Move around
Traditional predicate transition typically derives new predicates only at join nodes, using conditions from the JOIN ON clause. In contrast, our algorithm infers predicates from all explicitly and implicitly defined conditions throughout the entire plan tree. Here is an example:

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM (
        SELECT * 
        FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON id1 = id2
    ) temp1 
    JOIN 
    (
        SELECT * 
        FROM t3 JOIN t4 ON id3 = id4
    ) temp2 
    ON temp1.id1 = temp2.id3 
WHERE id4 > 2020;
```

(For clarity, I labeled each node.)

If we only iterate from top to bottom, at node 3, we only have `id4 > 200` and `id1 == id3`, which alone donâ€™t allow us to infer much. By comparison, our algorithm performs a pull-up before push-down, effectively "gathering information" from all nodes. 

For instance, at node 4, we learn `id1 = id2`, and at node 5, we have `id3 = id4`. When we reach node 3, which contains `id1 = id3`, we can infer that `id1 = id2 = id3 = id4`. Upon arriving at node 2, we can deduce that `id1 = id2 = id3 = id4 > 2020`.

With this knowledge, during push-down phase, we generate predicates `id1 > 2020`, `id2 > 2020`, `id3 > 2020`, and `id4 > 2020` and push them just above the table scan node.

An optimized Plan tree looks like:

## Algorithm Walkthrough
### A Common Pitfall
Deriving as many predicate as possible may not be a good practice.
